## What's in the folder

This folder contains all of the files necessary for your color theme extension:

* `package.json` — the manifest file that defines the location of the theme file and specifies the base theme.
* `themes/Dark Future Neo-color-theme.json` — the color theme definition file.
* `README.md` — documentation and preview of the theme.

---

## Get up and running

* Press `F5` to open a new VS Code window with your extension loaded.
* Open the color theme picker via **File > Preferences > Theme > Color Theme**, or use the command **Preferences: Color Theme** (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+T`) and select **Dark Future Neo**.
* Open a file with a supported language. The configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign *scopes* to the tokens.  
  To examine these scopes, run **Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).

---

## Making changes

* Any changes to the theme file are automatically applied to the Extension Development Host window.
* Edit `themes/Dark Future Neo-color-theme.json` to adjust colors and token styles.
* Reload the extension window (`Ctrl+R`) to see updates instantly.

---

## Theme integration with VS Code

* Token colorization is based on standard TextMate scopes.  
* Colors are matched against one or more scopes defined in the grammar.  

For more details, see the official [Color Theme Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme).

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code, copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart VS Code.
* To share your extension with the world, follow the official guide: [Publishing Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension).
